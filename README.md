|✅|✅|

 A TDMX mod to add custom puchi characters to the game. 

# Requirements
 Visual Studio 2022\
 A 1.3.0+ version of the game to compile IL2CPP versions, Mono is buildable without any version of the game.

# Build
 Attempt to build the project, or copy the .csproj.user file from the Resources file to the same directory as the .csproj file.\
 Edit the .csproj.user file and place your Rhythm Festival file location in the "GameDir" variable.

Add BepInEx as a nuget package source (https://nuget.bepinex.dev/v3/index.json)


## Mono
 Install the latest version of [BepInEx 5.x.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) into your TDMX v1.2.2 directory and launch the game.\
 Make sure you install the BepInEx_win_x64 version.


## IL2CPP
 Install [BepInEx 6.0.0-pre.2](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) into your TDMX v1.3.0+ directory and launch the game.\
 This will generate all the dummy dlls in the interop folder that will be used as references.\
 Make sure you install the Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64 version.\
 Newer versions of BepInEx could have breaking API changes until the first stable v6 release, so those are not recommended at this time.
